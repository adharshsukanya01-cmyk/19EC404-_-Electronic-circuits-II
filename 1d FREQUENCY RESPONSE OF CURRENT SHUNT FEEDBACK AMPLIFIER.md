### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
